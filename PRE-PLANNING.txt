# PIN Code System

# Codes are required to be entered upon an operator joining the server, if a player takes more than 2 minutes to enter their code, they are kicked.

# Code Creation: Codes will be a random integer between 1000 and 9999.
# Code Authentication: Codes can only be generated by force by a certain user, the build team leader.
# Code Verification: Codes can only be verified by operators, and only through a Graphical User Interface, 
# if they get it right - it flashes green, if they get it wrong - it flashes red and they are kicked.


# Summary:
# - An operator joins the server
# - A graphical user interface in which they enter the PIN opens up, they have two minutes to enter it.
# - If they enter it, they are authenticated, but still have to put up with the timelock.
# - If they don't put it in within two minutes, upon their failure to meet the deadline, they are kicked.


# Timelock System

# The timelock system prevents users from entering protected commands, such as the CyberBungee commands, and others.
# Operators have to enter a PIN in order to bypass the Timelock, they have five minutes to run the command, after that duration the PIN changes and they are locked out.
# PIN Creation: PIN codes are generated before and after timelocks are toggled, and are emailed to server administrators.


# Server blacklist

# The following users will be blacklisted from the server:
# - xStez
# - MinionEnd3r_
